* Quantum error correction

Two main error correction codes are analysed here:

- Repetition Code: A simple error correction code that protects against bit-flip or phase-flip errors by repeating qubit states multiple times and performing majority voting.

- Surface Code: A more advanced topological error correction code that detects and corrects both bit-flip and phase-flip errors using a structured lattice of qubits.

** Installation requirements
#+begin_src
pip install stim numpy pymatching sinter
#+end_src

Note: you also need to install `jupyter_compare_view package`, but currently with python version 3.13, it fails to install, so you will need to build it by hand.
